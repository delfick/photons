Writing Scripts
===============

There are two methods of instantiating Photons in a Python script:

* Using the :ref:`library_setup <library_setup>` function, or
* Registering a :ref:`task <photons_action>` like the tasks shown
  in the :ref:`CLI commands <common_cli_commands>` section.

Instantiating Photons reads in the configuration and registers all
the functionality provided by the various modules.
