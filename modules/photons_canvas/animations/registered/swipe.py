    Swipe from the right to the left and "erase" existing values as the lines
    go over them.

    There is one line for each row of the tiles and the positions set on the
    tiles are used as they are.

    The following options are recognised:

    rate - :range: of pixels - default between 0.2 and 0.4
        This is the number of pixels that are progressed each tick of the
        animation. This can be less than one and the animation will use tricks
        to make the progression appear smooth.

        The minimum is 0.01 and there is no maximum.

    line_hues - :color_range: - default rainbow
        The colours used to give to each line when they are created

    fade_amount - float - default 0.1
        The amount to fade the lines each tick. A small number will produce a
        longer line as it fades slower.
