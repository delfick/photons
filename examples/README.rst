Examples
========

To run these scripts first run ``source ../dev activate``

Then just run the scripts.

For example, to cycle a rainbow over your lights::

    $ ./cycle_rainbow.py

Unless you're on windows, in which case ``source ../dev activate`` won't work. On windows
make you're own virtualenv and ``pip install photons-core`` in it, or
``pip install -e .`` from the ``photons-core`` directory and then run the scripts
with ``python``. i.e. ``python find``.
